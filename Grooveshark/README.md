These were rescued after the shutdown of Grooveshark. They are pretty old, since I haven't used Grooveshark much since subscribing to Google Music All Access, and they're copied without any alteration using [GrooveBackup](http://groovebackup.com/). I'm not entirely sure that this method is adequate, since I think I remember my "Blues Possibilities list being substantially longer, unfortunately.
